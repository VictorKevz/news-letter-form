# Newsletter Form
![alt text](public/design/desktop-preview.jpg)
This is a newsletter form challenge from Frontend Mentor. The challenge is to build a newsletter form and make it look as close to the design as possible. Users should be able to add their email and submit the form, see a success message with their email after successfully submitting the form, and see form validation messages if the field is left empty or if the email address is not formatted correctly. Additionally, users should be able to view the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size and see hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page.


## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- React


## Features

- Responsive design
- Form validation for empty fields and invalid email format
- Success message displayed after successful form submission
- Hover and focus states for interactive elements

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/VictorKevz/news-letter-form.git
   ```

2. Open the project folder in your code editor.

3. Open `index.html` in your web browser.

## Usage

1. Enter your email address in the input field.

2. Click the "Subscribe" button to submit the form.

3. If the email is successfully submitted, you will see a success message with your email address.

4. If there are any validation errors (empty field or invalid email format), appropriate error messages will be displayed.

6. The layout adjusts based on the screen size for optimal viewing experience.
